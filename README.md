Project Overview
This project allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their height, weight, age, gender, and activity level to better understand their health and fitness status. The goal of this project is to help users understand their BMI and provide personalized health suggestions, such as fitness and nutrition tips, based on their results. The tool is developed in Python, JavaScript, and C#, making it accessible for different environments and platforms.

Features:
1.	BMI Calculation:
o	Computes BMI based on user inputs: weight, height, age, gender, and activity level.
o	Categorizes BMI into Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.
2.	LLM Powered Personalized Recommendations:
o	Health and diet suggestions based on BMI category, using LLM-generated content.
3.	Motivational Messages:
o	Short, personalized motivational quotes for each BMI category.
4.	Calorie Calculation:
o	Estimates daily caloric needs using the Harris-Benedict formula, factoring in activity levels.
5.	Data Persistence:
o	Saves user data in a JSON file (history.json) and allows viewing past records.
6.	Interactive User Experience:
o	Includes clear prompts, validation for user inputs, and reusability with a loop for recalculations.
7.	ASCII Art Display:
o	Unique feature to visually represent BMI categories.

Languages Features
Why Python for this project?
•	Ease of Use: Python's syntax is clear and beginner-friendly, making it easy to implement the BMI calculation in just a few lines of code.
•	Built-in Functions: Python has powerful built-in functions for handling user input and performing mathematical operations without the need for additional libraries.
•	Cross-Platform: Python is cross-platform, so the BMI calculator can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Why JavaScript for this project?
•	Common Language: JavaScript is widely used and familiar to many developers. Using it for terminal-based apps (via Node.js) allows developers to easily transition between web and CLI applications.
•	Event-Driven: Node.js provides non-blocking, event-driven architecture, allowing for fast and efficient handling of user input in terminal applications.
•	Cross-Platform: Node.js allows JavaScript to be run on any operating system, similar to Python.
Why C# for this project?
•	Object-Oriented Structure: C# encourages object-oriented programming, which can help in organizing and structuring the BMI calculator code more effectively.
•	Cross-Platform with .NET Core: With .NET Core, C# can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it suitable for this project.
•	Performance: C# is a compiled language, and its performance is typically better for larger applications, even though the BMI calculator is relatively simple.
